## **. Five DevOps Concepts**

### **a. Continuous Integration (CI)**

Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. Automated tests run after each commit to ensure code quality.

### **b. Continuous Deployment (CD)**

Continuous Deployment ensures that every change that passes automated testing is automatically pushed to production with no manual intervention.

### **c. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

IaC allows managing and provisioning infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. Tools like Terraform and Ansible enable version-controlled, repeatable infrastructure setups.

### **d. Containerization**

Containerization isolates applications in lightweight environments called containers. Docker is the most widely used containerization tool.

### **e. Version Control**

Version control (like Git) tracks changes in code, allowing collaboration, rollback, and managing different versions.
